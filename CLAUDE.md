# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

The canonical home of the `delegation-triage` package: evidence-graded routing doctrine for
delegating work to subagents (model × effort routes), the canonical agent roster, and the
package's own evidence loop. It is almost entirely Markdown plus stdlib-only Python scripts
(two checks + a multi-target installer). No dependencies, no test framework — the check scripts
ARE the CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs them as build gates on every push/PR to `main`;
note an expired STATE.md entry fails CI by design). Public repo (`loganrooks/delegation-triage`,
MIT); releases are tag-driven (`v*` → CI builds the Cowork plugin and attaches it). `dist/` and
`.planning/` are untracked (generated output / maintainer drafts).

## Programme charter (boot surface)

Direction and pace rules live in [`PROGRAMME.md`](PROGRAMME.md); current fast state in
[`LANES.md`](LANES.md). Read both at session start, after compaction/resume, and before any
lane-affecting change. The ratified priority order (PROGRAMME §1, passive-first 2026-07-31)
supersedes the handoff below on priority; the handoff remains context, not direction.

## Active initiative handoff

Before planning or implementing the multi-harness control-plane initiative, read the
[`2026-07-24 Claude initiative handoff`](docs/handoffs/2026-07-24-claude-control-plane-initiative-handoff.md)
and the [`docs/proposals` status map](docs/proposals/README.md). The first task is proposal review,
not implementation. The immediate product horizon is Claude Code + Codex: one citable evidence
base, provider/harness-specific route projections, governed learning from delegation outcomes, and
installable, drift-checked integrations. A new model release is a candidate and re-review trigger,
never an automatic route replacement.

The handoff does not authorize installation, activation, paid probes, cleanup, commits, or pushes.
Use the authority recorded by the later stakeholder disposition and implementation plan.

## Commands

```bash
python3 check_state.py                  # fail (exit 1) on any expired STATE.md entry or a missing/unbolded **Active: <profile>** line
python3 check_state.py --today 2026-07-12   # simulate a date (e.g. test a scheduled expiry)
python3 check_wids.py                   # fail on dangling W-IDs, broken relative md links, or absolute/user-specific paths used as dependencies
shasum -a 256 agents/*.md               # re-hash roster definitions for agents/MANIFEST.md stamps
python3 install.py claude-code          # deploy to ~/.claude (then stamp MANIFEST + restart); --check diffs deployed vs canonical
python3 install.py cowork               # build dist/delegation-roster-<ver>.plugin (deterministic zip; install via Cowork UI)
python3 install.py codex --dest PATH    # emit the consumer guidance fragment (no --dest: stdout)
```

Run both checks before committing any edit to the package's Markdown surfaces.

## Architecture — one decision, five surfaces

The package splits one decision (how to route a delegation) across surfaces sized by
consultation frequency × volatility:

- **`ROUTES.md`** — consulted every spawn. Task class → model × effort route | no-fable fallback |
  warrant IDs. Plus profile deltas (`balanced` / `budget-conscious`). Kept ≤1 screen.
- **`STATE.md`** — consulted every spawn. Volatile facts (active profile, scarcity mode, windows,
  prices), each row with `valid_until` + re-check trigger. **An expired entry reads as Unchecked,
  never as true.** The bold `**Active: <profile>**` line is a format contract — the deployed
  spawn-triage-guard hook parses exactly `\*\*Active:\s*([\w-]+)\*\*` and silently defaults to
  `balanced` otherwise; `check_state.py` enforces its presence.
- **`CONTRACT.md`** — onboarding + disputes. The delegation test (§1 whether to delegate at all),
  control-surface table (§3 — which surfaces can actually pin model/effort), fit-line discipline
  (§4), overlay convention (§5), escalation/feedback loop (§6).
- **`WARRANTS.md`** — load on demand, never per-spawn. Typed evidence records `W-001`…: claim ·
  label + grade + downgrades · resolvable locators with quoted primary excerpts · flip condition ·
  probe tally. Record headers must match `### W-NNN ` — that's how `check_wids.py` finds
  definitions. External repos are cited via the KNOWN-REPOS prefix key (e.g. `bridgewright:path`),
  never absolute paths.
- **`agents/` + `probes/`** — mint/deploy + post-mortems. Canonical roster definitions and the
  append-only evidence loop.

`SKILL.md` is the thin Claude Code procedure wrapper; `EPISTEMICS.md` carries the label
vocabulary (Resolved / Concordant / Reported / Corroborated / Provisional / Conjecture /
Contested / Unchecked) so records stay interpretable if the package relocates. `LINEAGE.md`
records provenance (SEAS ADR-0022/0024). `adapters/` holds per-platform packaging (Claude Code
install, Cowork plugin, Codex consumer notes); the core stays platform-agnostic.

## Canonicality and deployment model

Definitions in THIS repo are canonical; every deployed copy (`~/.claude/`, the Cowork plugin,
etc.) is a recorded deployment stamped in `agents/MANIFEST.md` with a sha256 content hash.
Deploy = copy + manifest stamp + **session restart** (a deploy is not live in the turn it lands,
but it is a delayed op, not a silent no-op — added types register on the next user-turn boundary;
corrected 2026-08-07, STATE `platform-pin-registration`). Manual install steps:
`adapters/claude-code/INSTALL.md`. After editing any `agents/*.md`, re-hash and update the
manifest table in the same commit.

## Editing discipline (the rules the surfaces themselves impose)

- **Same-pass propagation:** a post-mortem or probe outcome edits the affected surface
  (ROUTES row, W-record grade/flip counter, STATE entry) AND appends a `probes/records/` file AND
  updates `probes/INDEX.md` in one pass. Surfaces must never lag the records.
- **Probe records** (`probes/TEMPLATE.md`): only two fields are required — `attestation:` (how
  the outcome is verifiable; `self-reported` is allowed but tallied separately) and `tally:`
  (which W-record flip counter this feeds + count after this record). Everything else is
  requested, not enforced.
- **Flip discipline:** n=1 never flips a route row; ≥2 attested concordant is the floor;
  flip-prone classes accumulate ~3 per side. `probes/records/` is the source of truth on any
  discrepancy with INDEX counts.
- **Warrant records:** supersede in place; every load-bearing record states its flip condition;
  a vendor/model-card number is Concordant/Reported, never Corroborated; a bare grade with no
  downgrade reasoning is non-compliant (see `EPISTEMICS.md`).
- **STATE table format:** `check_state.py` locates the table by its `| key | value | valid_until`
  header and finds `valid_until` by header name — keep that header intact; config rows use an
  em-dash in `valid_until` to be exempt. A window extension is a one-line `valid_until` update.
- **No user-specific paths** in package files outside the WARRANTS KNOWN-REPOS "local hint"
  column and STATE/probes provenance cells — `check_wids.py` flags them. `references/ARCHIVE`
  and `references/routing-table.md` are exempt from W-ID/link checks (archives + stubs).
- **Profile ↔ pin coupling:** a profile delta that changes a pinned route also needs the pin's
  frontmatter edited — flip both in one commit.
- **Commit coupling — tracked changes that depend on untracked trees (review D-6, RESOLVED
  2026-07-24 as "neither"):** the instance — an uncommitted `ci.yml` adapter-test step requiring
  the untracked `adapters/codex/**` runtime trees — was resolved by operator decision D-3: the
  runtime moved to its own repo (`delegation-runtime:` in the WARRANTS KNOWN-REPOS key) taking
  the CI step with it; the `ci.yml` edit was reverted here. The general rule stands: before
  committing, check whether a tracked change references a path `git ls-files` does not return —
  land them in one commit or neither.
- **Deploy classification (review D-8):** `install.py <target> --check` reports `OK` / `BEHIND` /
  `DRIFT?` / `DIVERGED` / `MISSING` / `EXTRA` and exits non-zero **only on `DIVERGED`**.
  `BEHIND` (deployed bytes existed at some commit) and `MISSING` (never deployed) are normal lag
  for a package that appends evidence continuously and deploys occasionally. `DIVERGED` — clean
  source, yet deployed bytes appear in no commit — means a hand-edited deployment, the failure mode
  that silently forks doctrine; a plain re-deploy DISCARDS it, so reconcile deliberately and back
  up first. **`DRIFT?` is the undecidable case: the source file is dirty, so "never in history"
  proves nothing** — a deploy taken mid-edit puts never-committed but genuinely canonical bytes in
  the target. It reports, it does not accuse, and it does not fail the gate. (The check produced
  this false positive against itself one commit after it was written; the distinction is why the
  fourth state exists.) `EXTRA` names deployed roster definitions the package does not own; a
  re-deploy will not remove them.
- **A deploy from a dirty worktree is a preview, not a release** — its bytes are not reconstructable
  from the stamped commit. Say so in the `agents/MANIFEST.md` stamp.
- Known open items live in `STATE.md` (Scheduled items) and `agents/MANIFEST.md` (e.g. the
  unreconciled Cowork-plugin fork; the `sol-*` trio is ratified external overlay per D-2, not
  unowned — corrected 2026-08-01); check both before
  touching roster or scarcity entries.
