# LINEAGE — where this repo comes from, and what stays behind

**Minted:** 2026-07-10, Stage-2 execution of SEAS ADR-0022 (operator A4 GO + same-day home
decision; amending record: SEAS ADR-0024). **Origin:** `loganrooks/delegation-triage` (GitHub,
public + MIT since 2026-07-10) — identity = name + origin per the KNOWN-REPOS convention; the
local working copy is a clone, not the identity. Canonical home for the `delegation-triage` package:
routing doctrine (ROUTES/STATE/WARRANTS/CONTRACT/EPISTEMICS), roster (`agents/`), evidence loop
(`probes/`), checks (`check_state.py`, `check_wids.py`).

**Descends from (both ends annotated):**
- SEAS `SelfEvolvingAgentialSystems` — the programme that designed and ratified this package
  (proposal `proposals/2026-07-10-delegation-triage-offshoot.md`; ADR-0022/0024; Stage-1 run
  `research/2026-07-10-delegation-triage-stage1/`, whose `package/` copy is FROZEN as the
  Stage-1 audit artifact — see its MOVED-TO stub). The epistemics vocabulary descends from SEAS
  `governance/epistemics.md`.
- The `~/.claude/skills/delegation-triage/` living routing table (seeded 2026-07-02) and SEAS
  `harness/agents/TRIAGE.md` (2026-06-12) — the two drifted homes this package reunifies; the
  old table is archived (not deleted) at the `~/.claude` deployment.

**Adopted patterns (cite-vs-adopt — each with a local adoption record):**
- SEAS **ADR-0023** (programme-charter pattern) → [`PROGRAMME.md`](PROGRAMME.md) §3,
  adopted 2026-08-01 (drafted 2026-07-31; two-leg review incl. cross-vendor sol×xhigh —
  `docs/reviews/2026-08-01-programme-charter-reviews.md`). SEAS-side lane-board note: owed
  ([`LANES.md`](LANES.md) charter-propagation row) — cross-repo, closed by commit id when
  landed.

**Relationship going forward (the §4 graduation model):** this repo is its own selection
environment — new routing evidence accumulates in `probes/` here; SEAS keeps the genealogy and
receives feedback, not control. Deployments (`~/.claude`, the Cowork plugin, any Codex consumer)
are recorded copies stamped in `agents/MANIFEST.md`; drift is diffable, never
discoverable-by-accident.

## adapters/ (platform packaging — core stays platform-agnostic)

All three targets deploy via the multi-target installer (`install.py`, added 2026-07-10:
`claude-code` | `cowork` | `codex`, each with `--check`/`--dry-run`); deploys remain recorded
deployments stamped in `agents/MANIFEST.md`.

| adapter | target | status |
|---|---|---|
| `adapters/claude-code/` | skill + agents install into `~/.claude` (guard hook pre-existing) | scripted (`install.py claude-code`; INSTALL.md documents) |
| `adapters/cowork-plugin/` | generated plugin zip — replaces the 2026-07-10 GPT-5.6-Pro fork as the Cowork surface; ships no volatile state (graceful degradation, project-side STATE) | built (`install.py cowork` → `dist/`; 0.3.0) |
| `adapters/codex/` | consumer guidance fragment ("read ROUTES/STATE before delegating to Claude") | built (`install.py codex`; template in-dir) |


## 2026-08-14 — family rename: `delegation-triage` → `delegate-policy`

Identity change, provenance event ([family-naming proposal](docs/proposals/2026-08-14-family-naming.md),
N-1 RATIFIED rev.3; execution: [migration record](docs/reviews/2026-08-14-family-naming-migration-record.md)).
Name map for everything dated before this entry:

| old | new |
|---|---|
| `delegation-triage` (repo, GitHub `rookslog/delegation-triage`) | `delegate-policy` (GitHub auto-redirects hold) |
| `delegation-triage` (deployed per-spawn skill) | `delegate-triage` (act-name; the repo holds the artifact — policy — the skill performs the act) |
| `delegation-runtime` (repo) | `delegate-runtime` |
| `orchestration-learning` (Codex skill, code plane) | `delegate-learn` |
| `~/.codex/telemetry/orchestration-learning/` (data plane) | **unchanged** — the store outlives the code plane |

Historical records (probes, ROUTE-HISTORY, reviews, dated proposals, warrant bodies) are NOT
rewritten; old names there are recorded facts resolving through this table.
